# SRE: Debugging: Getting To Impact

During an incident it is critically important to understand if 
clients are being affected and to what degree.  This is the most 
important inflection point in any incident and can be used to craft an appropriate 
and proportional response.  A client impacting incident necessitates a full and 
immediate response proportional to the impact, whereas an internal, 
non client impacting incident requires a much lower level response, 
perhaps not even immediate:
