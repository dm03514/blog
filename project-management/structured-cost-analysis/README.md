# Structured Cost Analysis

Understanding cost is critical to the success and operations of any company.  Often times cloud allows engineers to purchase resources with little to no oversight.   This post walks through a structured approach to cost analysis based on 4 key states: Profile, Protect, Reduce and Project.  This approach will allow a company to understand their costs, protect themselves from unchecked costs, reduce usage based on empirical evidence and project future usage.

## Profile
Profiling is the first step for cost analysis and breaks down cost by major contributor.  This step is focused on describing the current state of the system (cost spending).  

Many saas and providers only provide coarse grained usage for bills. When a service provider only provides coarse grained billing *Proxying* is required in order to break down the bill along arbitrary dimensions.  

Consider a saas provider that bills monthly.  Teams use this provider.  Break down costs according to service.  

Proxy metric
The first step is choosing an appropriate proxy metric, common ones are, service, team, department environment, etc.

Breakdown


## Protect
The goal is to provide a feedback loop so that actions around costs are informed of their consequences


## Reduce
Map cost reduction efforts based on empirical profiles


## Project
Learn learn how cost scale in relation to user, each system adds to the total operating costs.  Users are the common denominator.  Businesses provide a service to their users in exchange for money.  normalizing on users allow for .  In tech normalizing on transaction or request are helpful intermediary calculations in order to project per service growth.
