# Visions, Projects & Priorities: Using Temporal Graphs to Build Your Own Reality

There's a huge problem in business right now.  The best prioritizers, decision makers, visionaries, and "shapers" use their abilities to disproportionately benefit themselves.  Deciding "what's next" is the most difficult part of leadership. There are very few resources on making good mid and long term decisions, weighing decisions for priority and optimizing complex decision options.  Without long term vision and structured approach to creating a reality companies are prone to fall into making decisions based on local optima: "What's the best move right now" or making decisions optimized around short delivery intervals: "What's the highest value thing to do in this interval".  Both of these disregard long term visions, the sorts of visions that .  This post explores the concept of temporal graphs and how they can be used to reason about reality and construct timelines in order to reason about long term initiatives.


## Temporal graphs

Temporal Graphs with respect to business and reality are ways to reason about causality.  Every action made creates new actions.  Have you ever read a choose your own adventure book? Most pages are left with a choice, and each choice either opens up the possibility to make more choices or lose choices.

Consider a case where you had an option to walk to work ~30 minutes, or drive to work ~20 minutes unless you hit traffic (25% chance).  You choose to drive because you worked out extra hard last night.

* home -> * drive -> * Wait in Traffic * Arrive
          * Walk  -> * Arrive

In the walk scenario getting delayed from traffic is a near impossibility.  There are an almost infinite other ways to get delayed but traffic is minimal.

At every moment in time there are a near infinite number of choices to make looking back over all choices that we made creates a path through a near infinite graph that we call our life.


Where we are are a result of the decisions that we made and the decisions that other people make, and random luck.  We can model these.  Successful projects and successful businesses also can be traced through a series of decisions that were made, that were given and random lucky events.

## End States


End States are critical at the top level of business and projects for success, it's unrealistic to hope to succeed as a by product of random luck or favorable events from other people.  Because of this, leaders need to have clear end states and be able to convey those end states, and execute to those states.  Leader in this case is anyone with a stake at moving the company to a different state (ie anyone responsible for changing the company).

WE'll walk through an example of how end states can be used.

## Intermediary states


## Levels of intermediary states (Abstraction)

Logical Strategy
Execution Strategy
Architectural Strategy
Day to day strategy



## Goals

If you have goals you can’t expect to reach your goals with out putting constructing itching events that we eventually we didn’t consider the goal of boarding if this is a go for you and your future speaking another language you’re getting in shape during the precursors to him making this a reality need to have a decision


## Exploration Breadth First


The goal is to open up favorable situations
Invalidate (fail fast) and prune parts of the graph that can’t help arrive at end state

Establishing a vision may involve some steps that are uknown or need to be discovered.  

There are many tasks that aren’t know beyond one or two steps these require exploration in order to get an idea of the possible paths , idea validation , product discovery, customer feedback all help create nodes on the graph nd open up possibilities .


## Pruning and Probabilities



## Lacking Leadership

Communicating a vision (end state) and a path for making it a reality.  In experienced leaders are unable to do this.  Many of the orgs I've worked for.


## Why?

Project management is hard
Project architecture  is hard
Decision making is hard

Many times instead of moving towards and end state we’re just trying to incrementally improve the current one.

There are surprisingly few heuristics or strategies about decision making in terms of roadmaps, priorities or execution.

Visionareiws see an end goal and can motivate others to fill in the middle states Project management is very interested in the middle states.


Visionary executives ("Movers as ray dalio refers to them") are able to do reason about the long term as well as the short term.

Project management is interested in the end state and specifics of all in between states


## Conclusion

For example if we're able to take tasks and assign them  numerical values such as ($ invested, investment time, return $$ or w/e) it's easy to define priority and the highest value items for the time given, that's relatively simple math, are there more strategies like this?
