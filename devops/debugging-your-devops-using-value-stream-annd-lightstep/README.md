# Debugging your DevOps Using ValueStream and LightStep - Root Cause Analyis
practices of devops are accelerating with the advent of continuous delivery. DORA, and cloudnative foundation.  The analysis of devops success and efficacy is still dark arts among sennior leaders.  ValueStream brings DevOps monitoring up to CloudNative speeds.  It allows This post shows how ValueStream can be used to help decision makers debug their delivery pieplines.  

Consider you're working for an organization and you would like to ship faster? How would you go about doing it? How do you map visualize and begin to understand the delivery process of each team in your org? How do you start to analyze candidates for improvement? Where do you begin to focus your efforts? 

This has traditionally been a difficult process. Just building a mental model of delivery for a single team (let alone multiple teams) may involved consulting multiple different systems for metrics, interviews, embedding, inferring metrics through proxies, relying on experience or just plain guessing and expirimentation.  ValueStream, backed by LightStep, completely changes this paradigm.  Delivery metrics are stored in a single system providing a uniform view into performance.  LightStep provides advanced debugging features of latency.  This article walks through how ValueStream and LightStep can help to quickly provide decision makers and with delivery root cause hypothesis.
