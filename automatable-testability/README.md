#Engineers Guide To Building QA Automatable Systems

Creating reliable testable systems is hard.  Patterns, tools and techniques to create systems that are easily observerable
and can be tested in an automated fashion.  

Backend engineers are already largely responsible for their own QA in many organizations.  Manual testers often can only
indirectly interact with backend systems.  This book should outline a number of strategies into how to create systems
that can support reliable, repeatable, and timely automated tests.
